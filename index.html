<H2>Summary</H2>
<p>I'm Giorgia, a 26-year-old Italian who has called Malta home since 2016. My professional journey began in iGaming, 
    where I honed my expertise in customer service and digital marketing, mastering skills such as SEO, website optimization
    and strategic planning. </p>
  
  <p>Despite my success in the iGaming industry, I found myself yearning for a more fulfilling career path. This realization led me to 
    resign and embark on a transformative journey of self-discovery. Over the past 8 months, I've dived deep in the world of Graphic Design, Web Design, UX/UI Design and Web Development 
    completing various courses on platforms like Udemy and Coursera.</p>
  
  <p>Beyond my professional pursuits, I absolutely love painting, drawing, gardening and delving into psychology books during my free time. I also like to be involved in voluntary initiatives 
    related to mental health support, environmental restoration and preservation. Nature holds a special place in my heart and I often find peace in walks, considering 
    it a therapeutic escape from the distractions of society.  </p>
  
    <p>Now equipped with a wealth of knowledge from these courses, I am eager to showcase my skills and contribute remotely. Let's connect and explore the possibilities 
      of collaboration!</p>
